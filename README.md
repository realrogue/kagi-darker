## Kagi Darker

I built this dark theme as I wasn't satisfied with any other theme out there. Inspired by Google and Brave Search.

It will be continually updated as Kagi Search changes and evolves, so star the repo and check back for changes!

As I use it everyday, I should spot any issues, but if I've missed anything, **[please raise an issue!](https://github.com/realrogue/kagi-darker/issues)**

⭐️ [Featured in the official Kagi Docs!](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/custom-css.html#kagi-darker) ⭐️

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This theme only works with dark mode, it does not, and will not, work with light mode. <br>
> Please follow [installation instructions](#installation) below.

## Features

* User-configurable colours at the top of the CSS file
* Search results clearly dileanated into sections
* Glassy header on desktop - inspired by Apple's Liquid Glass
* Pure black background for OLED goodness
* Pleasant animations throughout, and nice mouseover highlights make it feel interactive
* Fully responsive using CSS selectors for desktop and mobile
* Kagi Assistant theme that mirrors the search results, putting each message into a bubble so they're easier to read
* Kagi Assistant now has a sticky input field that has the same glassy effect that the header does.
* & much more!
