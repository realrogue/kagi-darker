## Kagi Darker

I built this dark theme as I wasn't satisfied with any other theme out there. Inspired by Google and Brave Search.

This is based on a wonderful theme by [pdanzma](https://github.com/pdanzma/kagi-css), but I've heavily modified and cut it down to suit my tastes, and to fix bugs on mobile in particular.

⭐️ [Featured in the official Kagi Docs!](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/custom-css.html#kagi-darker) ⭐️

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This theme only works with dark mode, it does not, and will not, work with light mode. <br>
> Please follow [installation instructions](#installation) below.
