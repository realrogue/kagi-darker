# Kagi Darker
## A Dark Glassmorphism Style CSS for Kagi Search

I built this dark theme as I wasn't satisfied with any other theme out there. Inspired by Google and Brave Search.

This is based on a wonderful theme by [pdanzma](https://github.com/pdanzma/kagi-css), but I've heavily modified and cut it down to suit my tastes, and to fix bugs on mobile in particular.

### NOTE:
This theme only works with dark mode, it does not, and will not, work with light mode. Make sure to follow instructions below.

**Known Issue**: Sometimes the image search grid won't load properly, just need to toggle custom CSS temporarily till you're done with the image search. Sorry about that.
